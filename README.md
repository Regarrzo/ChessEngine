# ChessEngine
A C++ UCI chess engine implementing alpha-beta pruning, killer move and MVV-LVA ordering heuristics. 

## Building
There are no dependencies aside from the C++ standard library. A standard of at least C++17 is required to compile.

## UCI
The engine only implements a rudimentary set of UCI commands and can't easily be used for analysis. Playing it, although, works flawlessly in Arena and LucasChess.
